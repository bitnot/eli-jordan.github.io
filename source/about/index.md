I am currently a lead developer at IBM, leading the infrastructure team of the cloud product Watson Content Hub. My first programming language was Haskell, but I was diverted into enterprise java for quite some time. I have always maintained my passion for functional programming and in the last few years have convinced my workplace to embrace scala and functional programming techniques. I believe strong static typing, and purity are the only way to maintain your sanity while maintaining complex distributed systems.
